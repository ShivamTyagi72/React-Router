Creating a React library that supports client-side routing in React .

We start off with the project definition and scope as well as several tips for getting started.
We then move to taking some notes on a potential solution architecture we can work towards.

Then, we implement the components top-down starting with the BrowserRouter Context, then the Route Component and finally the Link component which we will use in place of anchor tags in our Application.

During this process we look at various issues that pop up, debug them together and even handle new types of events and APIs such as the History Web API and the URL Web API.
